## Instructions

Create an RStudio project from this GitHub repository: Create a new
project, select "Version Control" for the kind of project.

I have provided a skeleton Quarto document that you can use with R or
Python.

You can also substitute a Jupyter notebook for the Quarto document if
you prefer.

## Working on the Project

You can copy any files you need into this project (R scripts, data
files, Quarto or Jupyter documents, etc.). Just copy the files and use
Git to add them, commit them, and push them to GitHub.

## Data Files

Please copy all the data files you'll use in the project into the
project directory and add them to Git. This will be important because I
will need to be able to download your project and render the report.

## Submitting the Project

To submit the project:

1.  Save all the files you're editing.
    -   Be sure your Quarto document and R scripts **do not** reference
        any files in other directories that are not part of this RStudio
        project.

        If necessary, copy the files into the project directory and use
        Git to add them to the project.
2.  Render the document into HTML, Word, or PDF format.
    -   Make sure it renders without giving you errors.
        -   Warnings are OK, but make sure it finishes rendering the
            document. At the end of the rendering process, RStudio
            should say, something like
            "`Output created: semester-project.html`".
3.  Update your Git repository and push it to GitHub:
    a.  Add all the new and modified files to the Git repository (e.g.,
        use the Git tab on the upper right of RStudio)
    b.  Commit the changes to Git with the "Commit" button.
    c.  Push your new commit to GitHub with the "Push" button.
4.  Double-check the GitHub repository and make sure the latest changes
    appear there.
